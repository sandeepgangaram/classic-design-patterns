# SOLID Design Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles for writing clean and maintainable object-oriented code.

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change. It should have only one responsibility or function.

2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP): A class should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to extend the behavior of a class without modifying its source code.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types. If you have a class hierarchy, you should be able to use any subclass in place of its superclass without breaking the code.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not need.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

By following these principles, developers can write code that is easier to understand, test, and maintain over time.
